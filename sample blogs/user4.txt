The Untold History of Your Favorite Snacks (Origin stories of Oreos, Pocky, etc.)

The world of snacks holds fascinating untold stories that make every bite richer. Let’s start with Oreos, the iconic chocolate sandwich cookie. Launched in 1912 by the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) in the U.S., Oreos were a direct competitor to the Hydrox cookie, which debuted in 1908 by Sunshine Biscuits. Though Hydrox came first with its chocolate-cream combo, Nabisco’s Oreo stole the spotlight with a sweeter filling and sharper marketing. The name "Oreo" is still a mystery—some say it’s from the French word "or" (gold) due to early packaging, while others think it reflects the cookie’s round shape. By the 1950s, Oreos cemented their legacy with the "Twist, Lick, Dunk" campaign, becoming a global sensation with over 450 billion sold to date.

Halfway across the world, Pocky emerged as a Japanese innovation. Introduced in 1966 by Ezaki Glico, these chocolate-dipped biscuit sticks were designed for mess-free snacking, with one end left uncoated for clean handling. Originally aimed at young women, Pocky gained traction with new flavors like almond in 1971 and strawberry in 1976. Its global expansion kicked off with a Thai subsidiary in 1970, and today, it’s known as Mikado in Europe and Rocky in Malaysia, adapting to local palates. Pocky Day, celebrated on November 11 (11/11, resembling the sticks), highlights its cultural footprint, especially in Japan.

Both snacks, born from creativity and competition, show how innovation can turn simple ideas into global phenomena. Oreos evolved through rivalry, while Pocky thrived on convenience and variety. Their histories reveal more than just recipes—they’re stories of cultural connection, from American lunchboxes to Japanese cafés, proving snacks are more than just food; they’re shared experiences.
